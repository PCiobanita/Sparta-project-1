### Challenges (you can include images and code block here)
1. Collision detection was a big chalange. I had to find a way to check colision between a line and player-object with coordinates always moving. 
2. Another challange was creating a delay between shape spawning. I have used requestanimationframe function which helps canvas refresh evrey frame. I managed to do it by keeping track of real time and using that value to create delay.

### Learning points
1. Using canvas: creating objects, shapes, using animation function.
2. Colission detection evrey frame
3. Learned how to add velocity on objects and using the velocity with animation frame to create a moving evect.
